# viagen-react-swc-ts

A React + TypeScript + SWC starter template for [viagen](https://viagen.dev) — a Vite plugin and CLI that lets you use Claude Code in a sandbox, instantly.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npx viagen setup
npm run dev
```

Once the dev server is running, viagen gives you an embedded chat panel where you can talk to Claude to build and modify your app. Edits trigger Vite HMR automatically.

To deploy to a remote sandbox:

```bash
npx viagen sandbox
```

See the [viagen docs](https://viagen.dev) for full configuration and API details.
